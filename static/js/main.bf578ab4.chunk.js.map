This was just as true when it came to the elections. </p>\r\n      <p>Nationwide, a record number of people voted – <a href=\"https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/226/\">close to 160 million</a>. Of that number, more than 100 million ballots were cast during the early voting period.</p> \r\n      <p>Already familiar with processing mail-in ballots, many states found themselves facing a huge increase in their number. In 2016, Idaho had less than 200,000 absentee ballots. But <u>in November 2020, that rose to almost 450,000</u>.</p>\r\n      <p>The reason, of course, was the pandemic. Not only were social distancing measures going to make the physical process of voting difficult, the virus was also taking its toll on the state’s workforce. The decision to mandate mail-in ballots as the only voting option was a visible reflection of those pressures.</p>\r\n      <p>There were other less immediately obvious changes ushered in by the disruption, too, as Foster Cronyn, Idaho’s Deputy Secretary of State, explains. Remote working led to what he characterizes as a series of cultural and behavioral changes.<span role=\"quote\"><em>We had to get people thinking differently about security, and the part they played in it, he says. Being more careful about their email, for example, or ensuring their computer would automatically go into sleep mode if left unattended</em>.</span></p>\r\n      <p>Idaho state’s cybersecurity strategist Brett Brandon explains: <span role=\"quote\"><em>Old practices for cybersecurity regarded your firewall as the perimeter of the network.</em></span></p>\r\n      <p>And while the election was – quite rightly – consuming time, energy and resources across America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html\">state-sponsored hacking groups were quietly undertaking what the New York Times described as “widespread intrusion into government and corporate networks.</a></p>\r\n      <p>This demonstrated the need for a broader understanding of cyber risks – along with an acceptance that combating them is everyone’s joint responsibility: states, organizations and individuals alike.</p>\r\n      <p>That theme of ensuring ongoing vigilance can be seen across a number of states, Ohio being a prime example.</p>\r\n      <p>Frank LaRose is Ohio’s Secretary of State and has served in both the 101st Airborne Division and the U.S. Special Forces. It comes as little surprise, then, that security is high on his agenda. “We had a saying when I was in the army that the bad guys only have to be right once, but the good guys and gals have to be right every single day. It’s all about vigilance. It’s about constantly being on guard,” he says.</p>\r\n      <p>That outlook underpins LaRose’s approach to cybersecurity – be prepared and stay prepared. In 2019, he orchestrated the creation of a security directive for Ohio’s election officials, to keep cybersecurity front-of-mind.</p>\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>We’re always preparing for the next thing as it relates to cybersecurity,</em></span>he says. <span role=\"quote\"><em>I’m a big believer in checklists. It’s the kind of mentality that pilots have – even if you have thousands of flight hours, you’re never going to take off unless you’ve completed your pre-flight checklist. Every pilot knows that.\r\n      Something as important as the cybersecurity of our elections should be handled with the same level of care.</em></span></p>\r\n      <p>Plus, of course, there was the pandemic, which threw so many election plans into disarray. <span role=\"quote\"><em>Every aspect of running an election was made more difficult this year. In many ways it was kind of the worst-case scenario,</em></span> he says. “I mean, I don’t think we’ve ever faced a more complex or difficult election than we’ve had.</p>\r\n\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <main>\r\n      <section>\r\n        <blockquote>One of my key priorities was to maximize early and absentee voting,” he explains. “The more Ohioans we could serve during the month before the election, through early voting and absentee voting, the more we could reduce crowding at the polling stations.</blockquote>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </main>\r\n\r\n    <section>\r\n\r\n      <p>That meant, LaRose says, that by the morning of November 3, 59% of Ohio’s ballots had already been cast before the polls opened.</p>\r\n      <p>These many and varied disruptions were creating challenges for those tasked with safeguarding the election. But at the same time, they became opportunities for those with malicious intentions.</p>\r\n      <p>Around late summer to early fall, the Microsoft Elections team was alerted to the existence of a cloned voter registration website. It had been built to look just like the real thing. Furthermore, it was being promoted via search engines and social media marketing, illustrating the levels of organization and sophistication at the heart of many hacking groups.</p>\r\n      <p>Unsurprisingly, plenty of people mistook it for the real thing, too, and whoever was behind the site had a degree of success in harvesting information from members of the electorate.</p>\r\n      <p>As soon as the site was detected, the team rallied to take it down, drawing on months of careful preparation. Their first action was to liaise with teams at Bing and LinkedIn and limit the spread of the bogus site. Its details were incorporated into algorithms scanning for disinformation and were used in Outlook spam filters to stop the rogue URL being shared far and wide via email.</p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Hope for the best, prepare for the rest</h2>\r\n      <p>Since 2018, CISA had been organizing training for elections officials, to supplement their cybersecurity knowledge and skills. Microsoft and the Brennan Center for Justice became involved, particularly after the courses – like so much else – were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Being able to deliver high-value training online was a vital part of ensuring elections officials stayed on track with their preparations.</p>\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>Something that’s unique, in terms of American elections, is that they are largely administered at a very local level. It’s very decentralized,</em></span> says Gowri Ramachandran, Counsel with the Election Security team at the Brennan Center, which is headquartered in New York with an additional presence in Washington DC.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>Over the past decade, and especially since the 2016 election, it’s turned into a job that encompasses cybersecurity, physical security, all of those sorts of additional things,</em></span> she explains.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>What that means in many cases, is that the front line of defense against state-sponsored hacking and highly organized cybercrime is a local government official. An official who has had to pivot rapidly to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, while trying to maintain control over their day-to-day responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>There’s more to being prepared than simply acquiring cybersecurity skills, of course. Ping Look is a senior director in Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team. She sees her role as that of bridging the gap between people, technology and culture.</p>\r\n      <p>The role of culture in increasing readiness to handle potential online threats\r\n      is, she believes, of vital importance.</p>\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>I feel that right now there needs to be a culture shift,” she says. For that to happen, everyone within an organization needs to be more security-minded and modify their behavior accordingly. “People keep clicking phishing links (in emails).</em></span>Look says.<span role=\"quote\"><em>You can’t just blame them for clicking the link if it looks totally legitimate.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Karen Intrachat, a principal program manager within the Microsoft Azure CXP team, also worked with those customers that needed additional support.</p>\r\n      <p>Being part of the Elections team project was, she says: <span role=\"quote\"><em>Great. A real one- Microsoft, collaborative thing. We started in December 2019, reaching out to customers. One priority was to analyze their architecture – looking for single points of failures, security vulnerabilities, the resiliency of their applications.</em></span></p>\r\n      <p>Elsewhere, checks were made to ensure customers had the most up-to-date versions of operating systems, platforms and applications. Patches were installed where required and additional support was provided to those who needed it.</p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Strength in numbers</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>The Elections team extended its network to make sure certain software vendor partners were integrated into the work of the Elections team. Like BPro, a software and services business based in South Dakota. It offers a variety of services, including voter registration and election management, that all run on Microsoft Azure. </p>\r\n\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>The systems we host in Azure have virtually unlimited storage capacity,” says George Munro, Government Outreach Director at BPro. “That means, any official records with a signature can be captured by our systems and all those signatures are automatically stored.</em></span> That kind of scalability is something BPro and its customers rely on.</p> \r\n      <p>By ensuring BPro, and other key vendor partners, were looped into the work of the Elections team, Microsoft could offer them access to greater support and faster turnaround times.</p>\r\n      <p>Steps were taken by the Elections team to make sure that no one on the list could lose access to their services due to something as routine as an unpaid bill. So, if a city authority or state legislature hadn’t paid for its email hosting or its Azure subscription, they were issued an automatic extension on their payment term.</p>\r\n      <p>Meanwhile, Intrachat’s team focused on finding the challenges a customer’s IT infrastructure might encounter, then presenting that customer with a schedule of actionable advice that would help overcome them. says Intrachat.</p>\r\n\r\n      </section>\r\n\r\n      <main>\r\n        <section>\r\n          <blockquote>In our resiliency reviews, we might discover a customer is running their election reporting application on a single server. But what if it goes down? Can anything be done to spread the traffic, and do they have a back-up procedure in place?</blockquote>\r\n        </section>\r\n      </main>\r\n\r\n      <section>\r\n\r\n        <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>This is an example of a critical situation where not only do you want your application to be highly secure, you also want it to withstand any spikes or changes within your infrastructure.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>In a year like no other, a day like any other day</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p>Fears over the consequences of a hack on some aspect of the election’s infrastructure have typically centered around the dangers of data being stolen or interfered with. But some of those behind such breaches know only too well that there is damage that can be caused simply by shaking public confidence. There has even been speculation that hacking groups, particularly state-sponsored ones, sometimes deliberately fail to cover their tracks. </p>\r\n        <p>Spreading doubt and seeding disinformation are some of the tools these groups like to deploy. The mere act of gaining access to a state or federal computer network during the election period could have fed directly into conspiracy theory narratives <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2020/election-integrity/\">including those that claim, erroneously, that the results were inaccurate and incomplete</a>.</p>\r\n        <p>The careful planning and proactive action taken by the Microsoft Elections team and its partners meant many potential threats were avoided. So, too, was the damage any successful attack could have caused.</p>\r\n        <p>The dedication and commitment of the officials running the elections, regularly working long nights and dealing with the twin challenges of the pandemic and greater security, meant the electorate was able to vote with confidence.</p>\r\n        <p>It also meant that, in the words of a CISA official, election day turned out to be <span role=\"quote\"><em>just another Tuesday on the internet.</em></span></p>\r\n        <p>And in a year like no other, that was precisely what was needed.</p>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </main>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default StaticContent\r\n","import './Footer.css'\r\nconst Footer =()=>(\r\n  <main className=\"Footer\">\r\n     Footer\r\n  </main>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Footer\r\n","import { useContext } from 'react'\r\nimport './Mobile.css'\r\nimport MHeader from '../MHeader/'\r\nimport MNetwork from '../MNetwork/'\r\nimport MHistory from '../MHistory/'\r\nimport MDarkweb from '../MDarkweb/'\r\nimport StaticContent from '../StaticContent/'\r\nimport Footer from '../Footer/'\r\nimport DemocracyStateContext from '../../context/DemocracyStateContext'\r\nconst Mobile =()=>{\r\n  const state = useContext(DemocracyStateContext)\r\n  return (\r\n    <main className={`Mobile ${!state.accessible ?
