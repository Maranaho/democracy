having to adjust to the challenges of running elections during the pandemic. </p>\r\n        <p>Groups including the Brennan Center for Justice and federal government agencies such as the

There\r\n        is no requirement for a formal relationship with Microsoft or its account teams. – anyone with a credit card can sign\r\n        up for an Azure subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>This kind of flexibility and immediacy is great for customers, but it raises the possibility of a customer using Azure as\r\n        part of their election infrastructure remaining undetected by Microsoft.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Keen to ensure customers wouldn’t miss out on vitally important support they might need, the team got to work.\r\n        There was a partial list of known Azure elections-specific customers, from similar work that had been carried out for\r\n        the 2018 midterm elections. That was a solid starting point.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The next step was to reach out to co-workers across the whole of Microsoft and ask them to share details of\r\n        customers engaged in elections activity.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Another similar wave of activity across Microsoft sought to identify any technology vendors using Azure. There are\r\n        many specialist elections services providers now running their products on Azure. Some are responsible for voting\r\n        machines, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The team also sought out political committees, campaign offices, and political parties that might also be using\r\n        Azure. Part of that outreach involved Microsoft leveraging its existing relationships with agencies like CISA, the\r\n        Center for Internet Security, and organizations like Defending Digital Campaigns – a nonprofit organization\r\n        providing access to cybersecurity products and advice to help secure political campaign groups, regardless of party\r\n        affiliation. These agencies were asked to talk to their customers and contacts, find out who was using Microsoft\r\n        technology and encourage those customers to make themselves known.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Between January and the summer of 2020, it was estimated that more than 90% of the work to identify elections\r\n        customers had been completed.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Training for awareness and readiness</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>One important aspect of helping those customers who had been identified was to ensure they were getting access\r\n        to relevant training and skills preparations.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Since 2018, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had been organizing training for elections officials\r\n        to supplement their cybersecurity knowledge and skills. Microsoft and the Brennan Center for Justice became\r\n        involved, particularly after these courses were disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Delivering high-value training\r\n        online was a vital part of ensuring elections officials stayed on track with their preparations.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“Something that’s unique, in terms of American elections, is that they are largely administered at a very local level.\r\n        It’s very decentralized,” says Gowri Ramachandran, counsel with the election security team at the Brennan Center.\r\n        The center is headquartered in New York and has an additional presence in Washington, DC.</p>\r\n\r\n        <blockquote>“Over the past decade, and especially since the 2016 election, it’s turned into a job that encompasses cybersecurity, physical security, all of those sorts of additional things,”</blockquote>\r\n        <ReadMore\r\n          caseStudy=\"Brennan Center\"\r\n          title=\"Helping election officials train, prepare, and grow their confidence\"\r\n          obj={{\r\n            \"Name\":\"Brennan Center for Justice\",\r\n            \"Location\":\"New York; Washington, DC\",\r\n            \"Mission\":\"The Brennan Center for Justice works to build an America that is democratic, just and free – for all\"\r\n          }}>\r\n          <p>With the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Microsoft, the Brennan Center delivered a\r\n          series of training courses to county and municipal elections officials from across the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>There were six focused training activities that covered crisis planning, scenario training and confidence\r\n          building. These included:</p>\r\n          <p>The importance of backing up systems and having a recovery plan in case of ransomware attack.\r\n          If voting machines stopped working, is there an available supply of paper ballots?</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>This training would ordinarily be conducted in face-to-face sessions. But with people working remotely\r\n          because of the pandemic, the training had to be reconfigured to work via Microsoft Teams.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>Liz Howard, Senior Counsel with the Election Security team at the Brennan Center, is a former election\r\n          official who has seen first-hand the way security has become a key issue.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>“This has been a tough year for many people for a variety of reasons. But our election officials have been\r\n          an incredible source of inspiration and hope for so many of us,” Howard says. “When I was an election\r\n          official, security was mostly about knowing who had the keys to the room in the basement where the\r\n          voting machines were kept.”</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>“Through grit and amazing determination, they have been able to conduct one of the safest and most\r\n          secure elections in our history, in spite of a pandemic, in spite of being under-resourced, and in spite of\r\n          any number of other challenges at the state and local level.”</p>\r\n        </ReadMore>\r\n\r\n        <h3>2020: An election year like no other</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>Nationwide a record number of people voted in the 2020 U.S. election – close to 160 million. Of that number, more\r\n        than 100 million ballots were cast during the early voting period. Many states, already familiar with processing\r\n        mail-in ballots, found themselves facing a huge increase in their number, due to the pandemic. In 2016, Idaho had\r\n        less than 200,000 absentee ballots; in November 2020, that number rose to almost 450,000.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Not only were social distancing measures going to challenge the usual process of voting, the virus was also taking\r\n        its toll on the state’s workforce, many of whom were unable to work or found themselves working remotely.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Brett Brandon, Idaho state’s cybersecurity strategist, explains the implications that had for security: “Old practices for\r\n        cybersecurity regarded your firewall as the perimeter of the network.” Remote working led to people outside the\r\n        firewall, outside of that perimeter, needing access to the network</p>.\r\n\r\n        <p>“We had to facilitate communications and make sure people and processes still worked, while enabling next-level\r\n        security,” he says.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Remote working also meant that far-reaching cultural and behavioral changes were needed, according to Foster\r\n        Cronyn, Deputy Secretary of State for Idaho.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“We had to get people thinking differently about security, and the part they played in it,” he says. “Being more\r\n        careful about their email, for example, or ensuring their computer would automatically go into sleep mode if left\r\n        unattended.”</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Idaho was just one of 50 states grappling with similar issues.</p>\r\n\r\n        <ReadMore\r\n          caseStudy=\"Idaho\"\r\n          title=\"Adapting to change and embracing the future\"\r\n          obj={{\r\n            \"State\":\"Idaho\",\r\n            \"Population\":\"1.78 million\",\r\n            \"Counties\":\"44 in total, some with just a few hundred voters and some with many thousands.\"\r\n          }}>\r\n          <p>In early 2020, while adjusting to remote working and coping with the impact of the pandemic on the health of some of its staff, Idaho embarked on a major IT upgrade project.\r\n          The state was migrating from its on-premise elections platform to one based in the cloud on Microsoft Azure. With the election coming and the pandemic disrupting workflows, the Idaho team faced some pressing deadlines.</p>\r\n          <p>Brett Brandon, the cybersecurity strategist in the state’s IT department, was part of that initiative and aware of the need to be ready for the November election, which would be the first time the new system would be fully adopted.</p>\r\n          <p>“We had to find a way to go through that full migration, understand the security risks, and make sure they were remediated,” he says. “This is where Microsoft had a huge part to play.”</p>\r\n          <p>The Microsoft elections team examined the infrastructure and network in detail, supplying the Idaho team with details of any necessary improvements.</p>\r\n          <p>“It certainly helped us focus on what we needed to concentrate on,” says Foster Cronyn, the Idaho Deputy Secretary of State. “As smart and as educated as we can possibly be, it is essential to partner with individuals and companies that focus on specific areas of technology and to take their expert advice when it is offered in a critical situation.”</p>\r\n          <p>“We’d certainly participate in that kind of operation again, without even giving it a second thought.”</p>\r\n        </ReadMore>\r\n\r\n        <h3>‘It’s about constantly being on guard’</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>Heading east about 2,000 miles bring us to Ohio, where cybersecurity was also high on the agenda of Secretary of\r\n        State Frank LaRose, who served in the 101st Airborne Division and the U.S. Special Forces.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“We had a saying when I was in the Army that the bad guys only have to be right once, but the good guys and gals\r\n        have to be right every single day. It’s all about vigilance. It’s about constantly being on guard,” he says.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>That outlook underpins LaRose’s approach to cybersecurity: Be prepared and stay prepared. In 2019, he was behind\r\n        a security directive for Ohio’s election officials to keep cybersecurity top-of-mind.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“We’re always preparing for the next thing as it relates to cybersecurity,” he says. “I’m a big believer in checklists. It’s\r\n        the kind of mentality that pilots have – even if you have thousands of flight-hours, you won’t take off unless you’ve\r\n        completed your pre-flight checklist. Every pilot knows that. Something as important as the cybersecurity of our\r\n        elections should be handled with that same level of care.”</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Just as it had in Idaho, the pandemic caused further complications for election planning in Ohio. “Every aspect of\r\n        running an election was made more difficult this year. In many ways it was kind of the worst-case scenario,” LaRose\r\n        says. “I mean, I don’t think we’ve ever faced a more complex or difficult election.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“One of my key priorities was to maximize early and absentee voting,” he explains. “The more Ohioans we could\r\n        serve during the month before the election, through early voting and absentee voting, the more we could reduce\r\n        crowding at the polling stations.”</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>That meant, LaRose says, that by the morning of November 3, 59% of Ohio’s ballots had already been cast before\r\n        the polls opened. By way of a comparison, in 2016 it was around 34%.</p>\r\n\r\n        <ReadMore\r\n          caseStudy=\"Ohio\"\r\n          title=\"Combining a security mindset with technical capability\"\r\n          obj={{\r\n            \"State\":\"Brennan Center for Justice\",\r\n            \"Population\":\"11.69 million\",\r\n            \"Counties\":\"88, ranging in population size from a few thousand to over one million.\"\r\n          }}>\r\n          <p>On Jan. 12, 2019, Frank LaRose was sworn in as Secretary of State for Ohio. A few months later, in April, he was an international observer of the Ukrainian presidential election. That, and his distinguished military career, gave him a real insight into just how important it was to maintain public confidence in elections.</p>\r\n          <p>“I served for 10 years in the armed forces and I travelled all over the world,” he says. “In some of the countries where I served, people don’t have a high level of faith in their elections and that’s very troubling. It’s easy to lose that trust and it’s very hard to rebuild it.”</p>\r\n          <p>“Our democracy works better when we’re all involved in it and being a voter is a really powerful way to impact the future of our nation. The good news is that elections routinely run so smoothly that people feel like they can take it for granted,” he said, referring to the U.S. elections.</p>\r\n          <p>But LaRose did not take it for granted and remains committed to safeguarding public trust in the institutions and processes of a flourishing democracy. Because of the security directive initiated in 2019, Ohio now has a network of intrusion detection alarms protecting its County Board of Elections. offers real-time monitoring of the Board’s systems and is supported by an ongoing cycle of training for new staff and refresher courses for existing staff.</p>\r\n          <p>Ohio has further embraced the idea that cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility with the creation of the Ohio Cyber Reserve, which LaRose likens to the National Guard. It’s a reserve force of civilian cybersecurity experts that volunteer as rapid response team in the event of a hack.</p>\r\n          <p>“We can activate the Ohio Cyber Reserve, load them up in a van and send them up to wherever the problem is to start digging in and working on the problem,” LaRose explains</p>\r\n          <p>“I think that it’s fair to say that cybersecurity is about creating the right culture as much as it is about the right technology,” LaRose says. “I mean, it’s that human firewall, so to speak.</p>\r\n          <p>“You can have the best technology in the world, but if you don’t have people trained to do the right thing, who take it seriously, who place an emphasis on its importance, the technology may not be all that helpful.”</p>\r\n        </ReadMore>\r\n\r\n        <h3>From customer care to culture change: All in a day’s work</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>Back inside Microsoft, there was also a clear understanding that cybersecurity skills are only one part of what’s needed.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Ping Look is a senior director in Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team. She sees her role as bridging the gap\r\n        between people, technology and culture, which she believes is a vital part of getting customers ready to handle\r\n        potential online threats.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“I feel that right now there needs to be a culture shift,” she says. By that she means everyone within an organization\r\n        needs to be more security-minded and to modify their behavior accordingly. “People keep clicking phishing links,”\r\n        Look says. “You can't just blame them for clicking the link if it looks totally legitimate.”</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Elsewhere, checks were made to ensure customers were thinking about the risk to their IT systems from any sudden\r\n        surges in traffic. Karen Intrachat is a principal program manager within the Microsoft Azure CXP team. She explains\r\n        that looking for the potential challenges a customer might encounter in its IT infrastructure helps them to focus on\r\n        the action they need to take.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“In our resiliency reviews, we might discover a customer is running their election reporting application on a single\r\n        server”,says Intrachat. But what if it goes down? Can anything be done to spread the traffic, and do they have a\r\n        back-up procedure in place?</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“This is an example of a critical situation where not only do you want your application to be highly secure; you also\r\n        want it to withstand any spikes or changes within your infrastructure.”</p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Threat hunters</h3>\r\n        <p>External threats tend to occupy cybersecurity professionals’ minds most. That’s certainly true for Sean Ensz, a Crisis\r\n        Response Manager in the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>He’s a threat hunter and as such is at the forefront of helping spot problems before they affect customers. He\r\n        believes cloud technology has made security efforts a shared responsibility between customers and their technology\r\n        providers.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>For example, in August 2020, Microsoft released a software patch for something known in security circles as the\r\n        ZeroLogon vulnerability, or CVE-2020-1472. But the time it can take to install such patches meant some\r\n        organizations remained potentially vulnerable for weeks, maybe months.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>“We issued warnings about this to state and local governments,” Ensz says. “To ensure they understood it was\r\n        important to install the patch.”</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The MSRC was also involved with spotting potential problems in the run-up to the election. “A few weeks before the\r\n        election, MSRC was engaged to help run a daily effort around threat hunting,” Ensz says.</p>\r\n\r\n        <blockquote>“We got threat hunting groups from around the company engaged on daily calls, set up a\r\n        team site for them to use, and then we sent out summaries on a daily basis, as well as a\r\n        weekly roll-up.”</blockquote>\r\n\r\n        <p>Drawing people and resources together from across Microsoft was an important aspect of the work, as it means\r\n        individuals get to learn from one another’s expertise. “The analogy we use is not being able to see the forest for the\r\n        trees. Individual groups are heads-down in their own areas of expertise and they do a really good job in those areas.\r\n        But they can have a harder time seeing the bigger picture,” he continues.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <blockquote>{`“One thing that I always find encouraging is, regardless of how difficult the incidents, that\r\n        really people come together. They're willing to collaborate and share what they\r\n        know and learn.”`}</blockquote>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Strength in numbers</h3>\r\n        <p>This culture of collaboration extended beyond Microsoft’s internal teams so that software vendor partners like BPro\r\n        were integrated into its work. BPro is a software and services business based in South Dakota that offers voter\r\n        registration and election management that run on Microsoft Azure.</p>\r\n\r\n        <ReadMore\r\n          caseStudy=\"BPro Inc\"\r\n          title=\"Connected to peace of mind\"\r\n          obj={{\r\n            \"Name\":\"BPro Inc\",\r\n            \"Population\":\"Pierre, South Dakota\",\r\n            \"Specialization\":\"A software services company providing on-premise and cloud-based election solutions to states and localities across the U.S.\"\r\n          }}>\r\n          <p>BPro’s 25 team members handle voter registration, election management, information portals, campaign finance solutions and election reporting systems in 15 states and around 100 different counties.</p>\r\n          <p>This company creates systems that pull data from sources like death registrations and help streamline the process of updating voter lists. The systems run on Microsoft Azure to offer scalability to its clients.</p>\r\n          <p>Many aspects of everyday life require individuals to verify their identity with a signature. Over their lifetime, a typical U.S. citizen may sign dozens of official documents. Those signatures are an important part of the identity validation process and the more examples of an individual’s signature there are, the better.</p>\r\n          <p>Having a lifetime’s worth of signatures available can be a logistical challenge. It would effectively mean keeping scanned copies of potentially hundreds of official documents per citizen. The storage requirements for such an undertaking are significant.</p>\r\n          <p>“The systems we host in Azure have virtually unlimited storage capacity,” says George Munro, Government Outreach Director at BPro. “That means any official records with a signature can be captured by our systems and all those signatures are automatically stored.”</p>\r\n          <p>Munro explains that the ability to offer enhanced data and document storage is only one of the benefits BPro and its clients get from the relationship with Microsoft. “At a moment’s notice, during the election, just having Microsoft on the phone, helping us address any issues that comes up is something that gives our customers peace of mind. They know it’s not just these folks from South Dakota who are working on the issue, it’s those folks in Redmond, as well,” referring to the location of Microsoft’s corporate headquarters.</p>\r\n        </ReadMore>\r\n\r\n        <p>“The systems we host in Azure have virtually unlimited storage capacity,” says George Munro, government outreach\r\n        director at BPro. “That means any official records with a signature can be captured by our systems and all those\r\n        signatures are automatically stored.” That kind of scalability is something BPro and its customers rely on.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>By ensuring BPro, and other key vendor partners, were included in the work of the elections team, Microsoft could\r\n        provide access to greater support and faster turnaround times.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>And the lessons learnt by the Defending Democracy team through all this varied work have been gathered into a\r\n        unified set of features, which is now being formally offered through Azure for Elections, a product which {XXXX}.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <h3>In a year like no other, a day like any other day</h3>\r\n\r\n        <p>The careful planning and proactive action taken by the Microsoft elections team and its partners meant many\r\n        potential threats were avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>But the work of defending democracy didn’t end on a certain Tuesday in November. As the period between Nov. 3\r\n        and Jan. 20 has shown, elections – even the most secure – are only one part of a much larger picture. A healthy,\r\n        open democracy requires so much more than its citizens to turn out and vote.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>News emerged in the earliest days of 2021 detailing how state-sponsored hacking groups were quietly undertaking\r\n        what the New York Times described as “the widespread intrusion into government and corporate networks”\r\n        throughout much of 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>These attacks and incidents, including the attack on the Capitol, further demonstrate the need for a broader\r\n        understanding of risks across the board – along with an acceptance that combating them is everyone’s joint\r\n        responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Naturally, cybersecurity is just one element – but it remains a crucial one. By the time campaigning for 2024 is\r\n        underway, the technology hackers rely on will have grown more powerful and the hackers themselves will have\r\n        become more sophisticated. The wider societal and geopolitical landscape will have evolved too.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The need to defend democracy will be as real as ever.</p>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </main>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default DarkContent\r\n","import './Credit.css'\r\nconst Credit =()=>(\r\n  <main className=\"Credit\">\r\n     <section>\r\n      <article>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <label>Reporter:</label>\r\n          <span>Sean Fleming</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <label>Visuals and Development:</label>\r\n          <span>Danielle Sovet</span>\r\n          <span>Maranaho N'Guessan</span>\r\n          <span>Paul Muggeridge</span>\r\n          <span>Alex Martin</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n      <article>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <label>Distribution:</label>\r\n          <span>Candace Lowry</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <label>Editorial:</label>\r\n          <span>Briony Harris</span>\r\n          <span>Rob Smith</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </article>\r\n     </section>\r\n  </main>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Credit\r\n","import { useContext } from 'react'\r\nimport './Mobile.css'\r\nimport MHeader from '../MHeader/'\r\nimport MNetwork from '../MNetwork/'\r\nimport MHistory from '../MHistory/'\r\nimport MDarkweb from '../MDarkweb/'\r\nimport DarkContent from '../DarkContent/'\r\nimport Credit from '../Credit/'\r\nimport DemocracyStateContext from '../../context/DemocracyStateContext'\r\nconst Mobile =()=>{\r\n  const state = useContext(DemocracyStateContext)\r\n  return (\r\n    <main className={`Mobile ${!state.accessible ?

This was just as true when it came to the elections. </p>\r\n      <p>Nationwide, a record number of people voted – <a href=\"https://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/226/\">close to 160 million</a>. Of that number, more than 100 million ballots were cast during the early voting period.</p> \r\n      <p>Already familiar with processing mail-in ballots, many states found themselves facing a huge increase in their number. In 2016, Idaho had less than 200,000 absentee ballots. But <u>in November 2020, that rose to almost 450,000</u>.</p>\r\n      <p>The reason, of course, was the pandemic. Not only were social distancing measures going to make the physical process of voting difficult, the virus was also taking its toll on the state’s workforce. The decision to mandate mail-in ballots as the only voting option was a visible reflection of those pressures.</p>\r\n      <p>There were other less immediately obvious changes ushered in by the disruption, too, as Foster Cronyn, Idaho’s Deputy Secretary of State, explains. Remote working led to what he characterizes as a series of cultural and behavioral changes.<span role=\"quote\"><em>We had to get people thinking differently about security, and the part they played in it, he says. Being more careful about their email, for example, or ensuring their computer would automatically go into sleep mode if left unattended</em>.</span></p>\r\n      <p>Idaho state’s cybersecurity strategist Brett Brandon explains: <span role=\"quote\"><em>Old practices for cybersecurity regarded your firewall as the perimeter of the network.</em></span></p>\r\n      <p>And while the election was – quite rightly – consuming time, energy and resources across America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html\">state-sponsored hacking groups were quietly undertaking what the New York Times described as “widespread intrusion into government and corporate networks.</a></p>\r\n      <p>This demonstrated the need for a broader understanding of cyber risks – along with an acceptance that combating them is everyone’s joint responsibility: states, organizations and individuals alike.</p>\r\n      <p>That theme of ensuring ongoing vigilance can be seen across a number of states, Ohio being a prime example.</p>\r\n      <p>Frank LaRose is Ohio’s Secretary of State and has served in both the 101st Airborne Division and the U.S. Special Forces. It comes as little surprise, then, that security is high on his agenda. “We had a saying when I was in the army that the bad guys only have to be right once, but the good guys and gals have to be right every single day. It’s all about vigilance. It’s about constantly being on guard,” he says.</p>\r\n      <p>That outlook underpins LaRose’s approach to cybersecurity – be prepared and stay prepared. In 2019, he orchestrated the creation of a security directive for Ohio’s election officials, to keep cybersecurity front-of-mind.</p>\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>We’re always preparing for the next thing as it relates to cybersecurity,</em></span>he says. <span role=\"quote\"><em>I’m a big believer in checklists. It’s the kind of mentality that pilots have – even if you have thousands of flight hours, you’re never going to take off unless you’ve completed your pre-flight checklist. Every pilot knows that.\r\n      Something as important as the cybersecurity of our elections should be handled with the same level of care.</em></span></p>\r\n      <p>Plus, of course, there was the pandemic, which threw so many election plans into disarray. <span role=\"quote\"><em>Every aspect of running an election was made more difficult this year. In many ways it was kind of the worst-case scenario,</em></span> he says. “I mean, I don’t think we’ve ever faced a more complex or difficult election than we’ve had.</p>\r\n\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n    <main>\r\n      <section>\r\n        <blockquote>One of my key priorities was to maximize early and absentee voting,” he explains. “The more Ohioans we could serve during the month before the election, through early voting and absentee voting, the more we could reduce crowding at the polling stations.</blockquote>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </main>\r\n\r\n    <section>\r\n\r\n      <p>That meant, LaRose says, that by the morning of November 3, 59% of Ohio’s ballots had already been cast before the polls opened.</p>\r\n      <p>These many and varied disruptions were creating challenges for those tasked with safeguarding the election. But at the same time, they became opportunities for those with malicious intentions.</p>\r\n      <p>Around late summer to early fall, the Microsoft Elections team was alerted to the existence of a cloned voter registration website. It had been built to look just like the real thing. Furthermore, it was being promoted via search engines and social media marketing, illustrating the levels of organization and sophistication at the heart of many hacking groups.</p>\r\n      <p>Unsurprisingly, plenty of people mistook it for the real thing, too, and whoever was behind the site had a degree of success in harvesting information from members of the electorate.</p>\r\n      <p>As soon as the site was detected, the team rallied to take it down, drawing on months of careful preparation. Their first action was to liaise with teams at Bing and LinkedIn and limit the spread of the bogus site. Its details were incorporated into algorithms scanning for disinformation and were used in Outlook spam filters to stop the rogue URL being shared far and wide via email.</p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Hope for the best, prepare for the rest</h2>\r\n      <p>Since 2018, CISA had been organizing training for elections officials, to supplement their cybersecurity knowledge and skills. Microsoft and the Brennan Center for Justice became involved, particularly after the courses – like so much else – were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Being able to deliver high-value training online was a vital part of ensuring elections officials stayed on track with their preparations.</p>\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>Something that’s unique, in terms of American elections, is that they are largely administered at a very local level. It’s very decentralized,</em></span> says Gowri Ramachandran, Counsel with the Election Security team at the Brennan Center, which is headquartered in New York with an additional presence in Washington DC.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>Over the past decade, and especially since the 2016 election, it’s turned into a job that encompasses cybersecurity, physical security, all of those sorts of additional things,</em></span> she explains.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>What that means in many cases, is that the front line of defense against state-sponsored hacking and highly organized cybercrime is a local government official. An official who has had to pivot rapidly to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, while trying to maintain control over their day-to-day responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>There’s more to being prepared than simply acquiring cybersecurity skills, of course. Ping Look is a senior director in Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team. She sees her role as that of bridging the gap between people, technology and culture.</p>\r\n      <p>The role of culture in increasing readiness to handle potential online threats\r\n      is, she believes, of vital importance.</p>\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>I feel that right now there needs to be a culture shift,” she says. For that to happen, everyone within an organization needs to be more security-minded and modify their behavior accordingly. “People keep clicking phishing links (in emails).</em></span>Look says.<span role=\"quote\"><em>You can’t just blame them for clicking the link if it looks totally legitimate.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Karen Intrachat, a principal program manager within the Microsoft Azure CXP team, also worked with those customers that needed additional support.</p>\r\n      <p>Being part of the Elections team project was, she says: <span role=\"quote\"><em>Great. A real one- Microsoft, collaborative thing. We started in December 2019, reaching out to customers. One priority was to analyze their architecture – looking for single points of failures, security vulnerabilities, the resiliency of their applications.</em></span></p>\r\n      <p>Elsewhere, checks were made to ensure customers had the most up-to-date versions of operating systems, platforms and applications. Patches were installed where required and additional support was provided to those who needed it.</p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Strength in numbers</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>The Elections team extended its network to make sure certain software vendor partners were integrated into the work of the Elections team. Like BPro, a software and services business based in South Dakota. It offers a variety of services, including voter registration and election management, that all run on Microsoft Azure. </p>\r\n\r\n      <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>The systems we host in Azure have virtually unlimited storage capacity,” says George Munro, Government Outreach Director at BPro. “That means, any official records with a signature can be captured by our systems and all those signatures are automatically stored.</em></span> That kind of scalability is something BPro and its customers rely on.</p> \r\n      <p>By ensuring BPro, and other key vendor partners, were looped into the work of the Elections team, Microsoft could offer them access to greater support and faster turnaround times.</p>\r\n      <p>Steps were taken by the Elections team to make sure that no one on the list could lose access to their services due to something as routine as an unpaid bill. So, if a city authority or state legislature hadn’t paid for its email hosting or its Azure subscription, they were issued an automatic extension on their payment term.</p>\r\n      <p>Meanwhile, Intrachat’s team focused on finding the challenges a customer’s IT infrastructure might encounter, then presenting that customer with a schedule of actionable advice that would help overcome them. says Intrachat.</p>\r\n\r\n      </section>\r\n\r\n      <main>\r\n        <section>\r\n          <blockquote>In our resiliency reviews, we might discover a customer is running their election reporting application on a single server. But what if it goes down? Can anything be done to spread the traffic, and do they have a back-up procedure in place?</blockquote>\r\n        </section>\r\n      </main>\r\n\r\n      <section>\r\n\r\n        <p><span role=\"quote\"><em>This is an example of a critical situation where not only do you want your application to be highly secure, you also want it to withstand any spikes or changes within your infrastructure.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>In a year like no other, a day like any other day</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p>Fears over the consequences of a hack on some aspect of the election’s infrastructure have typically centered around the dangers of data being stolen or interfered with. But some of those behind such breaches know only too well that there is damage that can be caused simply by shaking public confidence. There has even been speculation that hacking groups, particularly state-sponsored ones, sometimes deliberately fail to cover their tracks. </p>\r\n        <p>Spreading doubt and seeding disinformation are some of the tools these groups like to deploy. The mere act of gaining access to a state or federal computer network during the election period could have fed directly into conspiracy theory narratives <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2020/election-integrity/\">including those that claim, erroneously, that the results were inaccurate and incomplete</a>.</p>\r\n        <p>The careful planning and proactive action taken by the Microsoft Elections team and its partners meant many potential threats were avoided. So, too, was the damage any successful attack could have caused.</p>\r\n        <p>The dedication and commitment of the officials running the elections, regularly working long nights and dealing with the twin challenges of the pandemic and greater security, meant the electorate was able to vote with confidence.</p>\r\n        <p>It also meant that, in the words of a CISA official, election day turned out to be <span role=\"quote\"><em>just another Tuesday on the internet.</em></span></p>\r\n        <p>And in a year like no other, that was precisely what was needed.</p>\r\n    </section>\r\n
